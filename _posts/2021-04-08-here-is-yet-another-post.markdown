And I'm trying again to see how it is.

Psychotherapy is one of the few places left in the world where we can speak freely. Speaking freely to an accepting and skilled therapist can often result in our hearing and discovering things about which we were previously unaware. The job of the therapist is to listen, to have to courage to point out what is difficult, and to help us understand what keeps us from wanting to hear it in the first place.
