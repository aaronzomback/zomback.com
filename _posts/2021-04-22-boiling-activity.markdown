I remember I had one of those moments of lucid thinking a few years ago while on my walk down 58th st towards where I used to work at the Brooklyn Army Terminal.

It was in the brutal summer heat in New York, where the concrete begins to melt your feet at 8am and your skin becomes a swamp emerging from the subways.

Jackhammers mercilessly tearing the street. 

Sirens. Planes. Horns. 

Fumes and exhaust.

Tires screeching beneath the overpass. 

Repulsive bass blasting from a car.

The sun bearing down. 

People rushing for no reason.

I thought to myself, "this is not sustainable." 

Two years later the streets are empty.

A global slowdown.
